=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Git::DescribeVersion - Provide version using git-describe

=head1 VERSION

version 1.004

=head1 SYNOPSIS

In your F<dist.ini>:

  [Git::DescribeVersion]
  match_pattern  = v[0-9]*     ; this is the default

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This performs the L<Dist::Zilla::Role::VersionProvider> role.
It uses L<Git::DescribeVersion> to count the number of commits
since the last tag (matching I<match_pattern>) or since the initial commit,
and uses the result as the I<version> parameter for your distribution.

The plugin accepts the same options as
L<Git::DescribeVersion/new>.
See L<Git::DescribeVersion/OPTIONS>.

You can also set the C<V> environment variable to override the new version.
This is useful if you need to bump to a specific version.  For example, if
the last tag is 0.005 and you want to jump to 1.000 you can set V = 1.000.

  $ V=1.000 dzil release

=head1 USAGE

B<Note>: Since L<Git::DescribeVersion>
appends the third part to a two-part version tag
(for example, a tag of C<v1.2> becomes C<v1.2.35>)
This plugin is not designed to be combined with
L<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Git::Tag>
(which will tag the repo with the generated version).

Instead it works better with manual tags.
For example, you might manually increase the minor version
(from C<v1.2> to C<v1.3>) when a big feature is added or the API changes.
Then each build will append the number of commits as the revision number
(C<v1.3> becomes C<v1.3.28>).

This is probably more useful for projects without formal releases.
This is in fact the only way that the author still uses the module:
For C<$work> projects where builds are deployed often
to a variety of internal environments.

For projects released to the world I suggest using the simple and logical
L<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Git::NextVersion>
which does work nicely with
L<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Git::Tag>.
